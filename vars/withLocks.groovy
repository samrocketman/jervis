   This allows obtaining multiple independent resource locks from the lockable
   resources plugin.  This step will write variables to the run execution
   binding because that's the only way it can store persistent data without
   being a plugin.

   EXAMPLES

    Obtain two locks

        withLocks(['foo', 'bar']) {
            // some code runs after both foo and bar locks are obtained
        }

    Obtain one lock with parallel limits.  The index gets evaluated against the
    limit in order to limit parallelism with modulo operation.  Similar to
    workaround my color-lock example as documented in
    https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-44085

    Note: if you specify multiple locks with limit and index, then the same
    limits apply to all locks.  The next example will show how to limit
    specific locks without setting limits for all locks.

        Map tasks = [failFast: true]
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            int taskInt = i
            tasks["Task ${taskInt}"] = {
                stage("Task ${taskInt}") {
                    withLocks(obtain_lock: 'foo', limit: 3) {
                        echo 'This is an example task being executed'
                        sleep(30)
                    }
                    echo 'End of task execution.'
                }
            }
        }
        stage("Parallel tasks") {
            parallel(tasks)
        }

    Obtain obtain the foo and bar locks.  Only proceed if both locks have been
    obtained simultaneously.  However, set foo locks to be limited by 3
    simultaneous possible locks.  When specifying multiple locks you can pass
    in the setting with lock name plus _limit and _index to define behavior for
    just that lock.

    In the following scenario, the first three locks will race for foo lock
    with limits and wait on bar for execution.  The remaining two tasks will
    wait on just foo with limits.  As an ordering recommendation, in the locks
    list, foo is first item so that any limited tasks not blocked by bar can
    execute right away.

    Please note: when using multiple locks this way there's actually a
    performance difference between the order in the list of foo or bar versus
    reversing the order.  I have no control over this and just appears to be a
    severe limitation in how pipeline handles CPS sequence.

        Map tasks = [failFast: true]
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            int taskInt = i
            tasks["Task ${taskInt}"] = {
                List locks = ['foo', 'bar']
                if(taskInt > 2) {
                    locks = ['foo']
                }
                stage("Task ${taskInt}") {
                    withLocks(obtain_lock: locks, foo_limit: 3, foo_index: taskInt) {
                        echo 'This is an example task being executed'
                        sleep(30)
                    }
                    echo 'End of task execution.'
                }
            }
        }
        stage("Parallel tasks") {
            parallel(tasks)
        }

    You may need to quote the setting depending on the characters used.  For
    example, if you have a lock named with a special character other than an
    underscore, then it must be quoted.

        withLocks(obtain_lock: ['hello-world'], 'hello-world_limit': 3, ...) ...

    If you want locks printed out for debugging purposes you can use the
    printLocks option.  It simply echos out the locks it will attempt to obtain
    in the parallel stage.

        withLocks(..., printLocks: true, ...) ...
