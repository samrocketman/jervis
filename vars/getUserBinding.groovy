/**
  This step allows shared pipeline libraries to retrieve variables set in the
  runtime binding of the calling user's pipeline.

  Returns the contents of the variable in the binding (of any type).  This step
  makes it easier to access user pipeline data beyond being a functional-only
  context.

  Let's say a user has the following code in their Jenkinsfile.

        some_variable = 'foo'

    USAGE:
        getUserBinding('some_variable')

            returns String 'foo'
