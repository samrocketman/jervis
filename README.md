##### What is Jervis?

* What is Jervis? A library for [Job DSL plugin][jenkins-plugin-job-dsl]
  scripts and [shared Jenkins pipeline libraries][pipeline].  It is used to
  augment the automation of generating Jenkins jobs.
* [SCM Filter Jervis plugin][scm-filter-jervis] is available for multibranch
  pipline filtering.  Installing this plugin also makes the Jervis library
  available for import in shared pipeline libraries.

# Documentation

* [Jervis Wiki][jervis-wiki]
  * [Build Overview][jervis-wiki-overview]
  * [Supported Languages][jervis-wiki-languages]
  * [Supported Build Tools][jervis-wiki-build-tools]


The library API is also [fully documented][jervis-api-docs].  To generate the
latest developer docs execute the following command.

    ./gradlew groovydoc

The documentation can be found in `build/docs/groovydoc`.

##### Provided examples

* Bootstrapping Jenkins: Example [bootstrap for
  Jenkins][jervis-jenkins-bootstrap] which allows you to quickly try out this
  library.
* Job DSL Script: [Example Job DSL script](jobs/firstjob_dsl.groovy) is
  provided.
* Jenkins build node: There's also a [docker container][jervis-docker] designed
  to be used as a Jenkins build agent through the [Jenkins Docker
  Plugin][jenkins-plugin-docker].
* Jervis configuration files: [`lifecycles.yaml`][yaml-lifecycles],
  [`toolchains.yaml`][yaml-toolchains], and [`platforms.yaml`][yaml-platforms].
* Shared pipeline library: [`vars/`](vars) and [`resources/`](resources)
  directories.

# More about Jervis

Jervis is a combination of some letters in the words Jenkins and Travis: JEnkins
tRaVIS.  [Jenkins][jenkins] is a [continuous integration][wiki-ci] tool which is
typically installed on premises.  [Travis][travis] is a hosted, distributed
continuous integration system used by many [open source][wiki-os] projects.
Both Jenkins and Travis have paid and enterprise offerings.

Jervis uses Travis-like job generation using the [Job DSL
plugin][jenkins-plugin-job-dsl] and groovy scripts.  It reads the `.jervis.yml`
file of a project and generates a job in Jenkins based on it.  If `.jervis.yml`
doesn't exist then it will fall back to using the [`.travis.yml`][travis-yaml]
file.

For development planning and other documentation see the [Jervis
wiki][jervis-wiki].  If you wish to stay up to date with the latest Jervis news
then please feel free to [watch this repository][watch-repo] because I use the
issue tracking and wiki for planning.

## Why Jervis?

What is Jervis attempting to scale?  Let's talk about some scale bottlenecks
that have been overcome by Jenkins (formerly Hudson) and its community.

The scaling issue is a main bullet. The solution for the issue is in a
sub-bullet.

* Developers are challenged with integrating work, building often, and even
  deploying often.
  * Jenkins was invented.
* Jenkins infrastructure is strained when too many agents are in one server and
  too many jobs are queued up on a daily basis.  A single Jenkins server
  struggles to perform all requested builds in a timely manner.  Jenkins also
  suffers from single point of failure as a lone server.
  * Multi-controller Jenkins was invented. This provides redundancy for the
    server.  Throughput for daily build capacity is improved.
* Jenkins jobs suffer from a lot of duplicate code.  It is difficult to fix a
  bug in one job and have it propagate to other jobs.
  * Jenkins Job DSL plugin was invented.  Configuration through code is now
    possible.  Multiple jobs can be generated and regenerated with the same code
    using templates in a domain specific language.
* Onboarding new projects in a Jenkins installation can be difficult.  Typically
  engineers will get together and discuss the needs of the project and then
  configure a Jenkins job for the needs of the project.  For enterprises with a
  very large number of projects it is typically hard to scale number of build
  engineers to match with the large number of projects which require onboarding
  into the build ecosystem.
  * Jervis is being invented.  Job generation through convention over
    configuration.  Scaling the onboarding for a project by creating and abiding
    by conventions in how jobs are generated.  This is for large scale job
    generation and project onboarding.  Jervis is taking lessons learned from a
    seasoned build engineer and attempting to fill this gap in the Jenkins
    ecosystem.

# Set up

To include this library for use in your Job DSL plugin scripts you only need
include it in your build tool.

#### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.gleske</groupId>
  <artifactId>jervis</artifactId>
  <version>2.0</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle

Your Job DSL scripts should have a `build.gradle` file which has the following
contents.

```gradle
apply plugin: 'maven'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}


configurations {
    libs
}

dependencies {
    libs 'net.gleske:jervis:2.0'
    libs 'org.yaml:snakeyaml:2.0'
}

task cleanLibs(type: Delete) {
    delete 'lib'
}

task libs(type: Copy) {
    into 'lib'
    from configurations.libs
}

defaultTasks 'clean', 'libs'
clean.dependsOn cleanLibs
```

Then execute `./gradlew libs` to assemble dependencies into the `lib` directory
of the Jenkins workspace.  Don't forget to add `lib` to the classpath.  This
must be done before you configure your Jenkins job to execute Job DSL scripts.
